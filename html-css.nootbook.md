## formalize
[http://formalize.me](http://formalize.me/)
We've all been there. You are nearly done with a beautiful site design, only to arrive at the task we all dread – form styling. Depending on operating system and browser, default form elements can look okay or horribly disfigured.
While Formalize is primarily a CSS framework, it does rely on a bit of JavaScript to bridge the gap in HTML5 support for older browsers.
