# Software Developement Methodologies

## Agile
Agile software development is a group of software development methods based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It is a conceptual framework that promotes foreseen interactions throughout the development cycle. The Agile Manifesto[1] introduced the term in 2001.

Agile software development methodologies like Scrum are easy to learn, but hard to master. It's easy to get some of the details wrong. This could keep your team from receiving all the benefits the framework has to offer, or worse, lead to poor communication and defects.
