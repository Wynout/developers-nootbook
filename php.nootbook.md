Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP.

It allows you to declare the dependent libraries your project needs and it will install them in your project for you.

It borrows many ideas from npm and uses basic json files for package definitions.
Composer packages are generally published on the packagist, but can also be published & installed from other servers
