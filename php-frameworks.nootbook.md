## Laravel
[http://laravel.com](http://laravel.com/)
Laravel is a powerful framework that emphasizes flexibility and expressiveness. Users new to Laravel will enjoy the same ease of development that is found in the most popular and lightweight PHP frameworks. More experienced users will appreciate the opportunity to modularize their code in ways that are not possible with other frameworks. Laravel's flexibility will allow your organization to update and mold the application over time as is needed and its expressiveness will allow you and your team to develop code that is both concise and easily read.
